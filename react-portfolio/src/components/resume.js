<p><strong>INTERESTS AND ACTIVITIES</strong></p>
<hr></hr>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Web Development (MERN stack)</strong></p>
<p>Even during my free time I am always looking to improve my development skills whether it be completing courses on Udemy and Lynda.com, i&rsquo;m always keen to see what new things I can create using frameworks and libraries. Recently I have been looking into WebGL libraries (PIXIJS) for games development and now Laravel to create a lightweight social network.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Current Projects</u></strong></p>
<p><em>PHP Laravel based Social Network, React Based Portfolio, PixiJS based canvas game, QandA PWA using ReactJS and Express (NodeJS). </em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Raspberry Pi</strong></p>
<p>During my free time I spend a lot of time working on small projects with the Raspberry Pi development board which I enjoy tinkering with. I currently have a web server running at home and another Pi setup running a room temperature control system that alerts me when the room temperature is above or below 22 degrees. Other projects include (Snake tank monitor, Arcade cabinet, AI webcam).</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>PC Gaming and computing</strong></p>
<p>I have a passion for building custom PC&rsquo;s and I play a lot of PC games when I have the time. I also have a wide interest in website design and the use of Virtual reality. I also occasionally use my Vive for producing prototypes for games using the HTC Vive plugins available in Unity.</p>
<p><strong>Rugby</strong></p>
<p>I was previously a member of the Men&rsquo;s Rugby Union Society at University. I enjoy the exercise and social side of rugby. Each week we had two training sessions and a game each Wednesday.</p>
<p><strong>Piano and Guitar</strong></p>
<p>I am a musician and have played both electric and classical guitar from a young age taking heavy inspiration from Jimi Hendrix and Eric Clapton.I also enjoy playing piano and have a specific interest in playing both video game and movie scores.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>DJing &amp; Music Production</strong></p>
<p>I have been Djing since I was 16,&nbsp; I currently Dj at venues around Lincoln and Boston, I now use Logic Pro X and Ableton live to record and produce electronic music along with acoustic tracks which I upload to Soundcloud.</p>
